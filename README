To build the project, you need to goto the project directory and type the following in command line:
bison -dv smallc.y
gcc -c smallc.tab.c
flex smallc.lex
gcc -c lex.yy.c
gcc -o scc smallc.tab.o lex.yy.o -lm

ATTENTION: You cannot use yacc to build the smallc.y because I use some of the unique feature of bison in my project!
To run the smallc compiler, simply type:

./scc "Source file name" "Output file name"

The Output file name should have the suffix ".s"
Then the three-address-code will be generated to a file called InterCode
And the MIPS code will be generated to Output file
To run the MIPS code, choose Load File in MIPS and run

I provide three types of example programs, all the example programs have suffix ".sc"

1. error test
example for error test is in the folder error_test, to run the error test program, simply type:

./scc error_test/error_N.sc "Output file name"

Here N ranges from 1~9 representing the 9 semantic analysis in the report

2. optimization test
example for optimization test is in the folder opt_test, to run the optimization test program, simply type:

./scc opt_test/optim_N.sc "Output file name"

Here N ranges from 1~6 representing the 6 optimizations in the report

3. sample test
example for sample test is in the folder sample_test, to run the optimization test program, simply type:

./scc sample_test/"Input file name" "Output file name"

Here Input file name are:

arith_test.sc: for arithmetic calculation. Just run the file and SPIM will give the answer.
test_struct.sc: for structure test. Just run the file and SPIM will give the answer.
hex_oct_test.sc: for hex and oct number test. Just run the file and SPIM will give the answer.
eight_queens.sc: This program calculates the number of solutions of 8 queens problem. Just run the file and SPIM will give the answer.
fib.sc: This program calculates the n fibonacci number. You can enter n in SPIM and see the result.
hanoi.sc: This program prints the solution for n hanoi tower. You can enter n in SPIM and see the result.
loop_test.sc: for loop test. Just run the file and SPIM will give the answer.
sort.sc: This program sorts an array and print the sorted array. Just run the file and SPIM will give the answer.

A list of all files in my project

error_test, contains 9 error_test .sc file
opt_test, contains 6 error_test .sc file
sample_test, contains 9 sample .sc file
